  // Programming is all about writing commands which computers can understand
  // in a human-readable way. One of the most comman tasks we are faced with is
  // decision making and that decision making often becomes the core of a program.
  //
  // In JavaScript, and most other programming languages, the if-statement is meant
  // to be readable in a natural-language way. For example, you might say "If I'm tired,
  // make coffee". This can easily be written in JavaScript in an if-statement following
  // similar wording:
  //
  //   const developerIsTired = true
  //
  //   if (developerIsTired) {
  //     console.log("Make coffee!")
  //   }
  //
  // You could also handle the "developer isn't tired" case using the keyword `else`:
  //
  //   if (developerIsTired) {
  //     console.log("Make coffee!")
  //   } else {
  //     console.log("Make tea!")
  //   }

  // Task: Below is a variable which stores the speed a car is travelling. Write an if statement
  // below the varaible which prints "Slow down!" if the car is travelling above 100, or
  // prints "Carry on" if it's travelling below 100.
  //
  // Take a look at this page on number comparison operators to see how to check if number is
  // greater than or less than another number: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp

  const carSpeed = 85;

  if (carSpeed > 100) {
    console.log("Slow down!");
  } else {
    console.log("Carry on");
  }
