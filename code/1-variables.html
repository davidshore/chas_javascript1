    //
    // Your task is to re-assign the `fruit` variable to "Orange" by re-assigning
    // the fruit variable a new value (so first it should be set to "Apple", and
    // then on another line, it should be assigned "Orange").
  
    const fruit = "Apple"

    // To complete this task, you should see "The fruit is Orange" in the console.
