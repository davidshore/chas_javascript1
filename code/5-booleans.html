  // Conditional statements require an assertion inside the parenthesis to determine
  // whether the code block (between { and }) should be run. If the assertion equates to
  // `true`, then the code is run. Otherwise it is not, and if the conditional statement has
  // an `else` clause, then that block of code is run instead.
  //
  // Take a look at the comparisons operators documentation again: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp
  // and consider the "returns" column of each example. That's the key to which way the if-statement
  // will go.
  //
  // This task requires you to use examples from that documentation to write if statements
  // which either use a boolean value in the assertion, or compare two values to return
  // either true or false.

  // Task 1: Below is a variable which stores the word count of a blog post I'm writing.
  //         Write an if-statement which logs (console.log) "Get writing!" if the number is 0.
  const wordCount = 0;

  if (wordCount === 0) {
    console.log("Get writing!");
  }

  // Task 2: Use the "and" logical operator (&&) to chain two assertions together. Below are two
  //         variables; one which stores the current temperature, and one which stores whether
  //         someone has gone for a run today. Write an if-statement which prints "Go for a run!"
  //         if the current temperature is greater than 10, and the goneForARun is false.
  const currentTemperature = 15;
  const goneForARun = false;

  if (currentTemperature > 10 && !goneForARun) {
    console.log("Go for a run!");
  }

  // Task 3: Using .length() to get the length of a string and the `name` variable below,
  //         write an "else if" statement which prints the following:
  //         * "You have a long name!" if the length of the name is greater than 10 characters long
  //         * "You have a short name!" if the length of the name is less than 5 characters long
  //         * "You have a medium length name!" if neither of the other two assertions is true
  //
  // Documentation: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp
  const name = "Mary";

  if (name.length > 10) {
    console.log("You have a long name!");
  } else if (name.length < 5) {
    console.log("You have a short name!");
  } else {
    console.log("You have a medium length name!");
  }
