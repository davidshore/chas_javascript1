    // Programming is all about writing commands which computers can understand
    // in a human-readable way. One of the most comman tasks we are faced with is
    // decision making and that decision making often becomes the core of a program.
    //
    // In JavaScript, and most other programming languages, the if-statement is meant
    // to be readable in a natural-language way. For example, you might say "If I'm tired,
    // make coffee". This can easily be written in JavaScript in an if-statement following
    // similar wording:
    //
    //   const developerIsTired = true
    //
    //   if (developerIsTired) {
    //     console.log("Make coffee!")
    //   }
    //
    // You could also handle the "developer isn't tired" case using the keyword `else`:
    //
    //   if (developerIsTired) {
    //     console.log("Make coffee!")
    //   } else {
    //     console.log("Make tea!")
    //   }
  
    // Task: Below is a variable which stores the speed a car is travelling. Write an if statement
    // below the varaible which prints "Slow down!" if the car is travelling above 100, or
    // prints "Carry on" if it's travelling below 100.
    //
    // Take a look at this page on number comparison operators to see how to check if number is
    // greater than or less than another number: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp
  
    const carSpeed = 110
    if (carSpeed > 100){
      console.log("Slow down!")

    }else {
      console.log("Carry on")
    }
