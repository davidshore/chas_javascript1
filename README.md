## av Viktor Risinger

Todays assignment is a collection of small challenges designed to give you a chance to practice your JavaScript skills.

## How to complete this assignment

In the `code` folder, you'll find a number of tasks in html files. Go through each file and follow the instructions. Links to documentation for specific tasks can be found in the comments in the task files.

To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, make changes to your copy, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into this one) for review. [Read the guide on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more info on how to do this.

### :sos: How to get help

Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask David. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment, you should start feeling a little more comfortable with the core concepts of the JavaScript language - variables, types, conditional statements, and functions.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

Done with the main task? The morning lecture and this task use es6 JavaScript syntax. The stretch goal is to try to complete each of the tasks in the code files using the older es5 syntax. To do that, just copy each of the challenge files to a new version and change your code to not use any es6 features. For example, copy 1-variables.html to be 1-variables-es5.html.

Still looking for more? In a new file, try to write a solution to the "FizzBuzz" question below (which is sometimes used in interviews, so good to know):

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Of course you'll be able to find solutions for the problem by googling, but only do that if you're completely stuck and want to see a solution! How you approach the problem is up to you, but the [modulo operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators) will come in very handy.
